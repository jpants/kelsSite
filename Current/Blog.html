								Thinking Little...
						</td>

						<td class='articleBlog'>
								Social media helps us see, now more than ever, those “special” individuals who have risen out of something “small” to something “big”.  You know the people who have been working a regular 9 to 5 job who suddenly quit to start something new, and it seems to the onlooker that this new endeavor finds success instantly.  This seems BIG and often what I do seems so very small.  Unfortunately, we so often do not get to see all the “little” that these individuals have to go through to make it to the “big”.<br><br>

								I’ve noticed that I can do big/little comparisons in my relationship with Jesus.  Jesus says in Luke 6:28, “Bless those who curse you, pray for those who mistreat you.”  Well I somehow take that and think it only relates to “big” issues.  If someone says something mean about me or to me I have every right to be upset and I don’t need to bless them.  In fact, I somehow justify a way to write them off completely.   Honest moment here, I’m not sure I have prayed for hardly anyone who has mistreated me.  I’ve “vented” about them a lot.  In my mind I have had some great comebacks for their unkind words or actions.  The blessing part though…not so much.<br><br>

								Moving away from only thinking big is difficult, because that is part of our human experience.  We remember the “big” moments.  We remember birthday parties, weddings, hilarious game nights, embarrassments, failures, and missed opportunities.  We often don’t think small because thinking small requires seeing small things.  I don’t see the improvement I make in my ability to play the piano until I look back at a recording from a year ago.  Then I am shocked to realize that my small amount of practice has actually mattered.  I don’t think that one “small” interaction that I don’t handle in a way that Jesus would, effects my life.  But what I don’t see is how habitual mistreatment of people will eventually lead somewhere in the big picture.  To be honest, it’s a sobering reality to think that I could wake up one day and realize that a few instances of not treating people well has deeply affected me.  When I don’t fight for relationships in a healthy way, I will lose in the end.  I may not see it now, but those things don’t stay hidden forever.<br><br>

								Mark 12:30-31 Love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind and with all your strength.’ 31 The second is this: ‘Love your neighbor as yourself.’There is no commandment greater than these.”<br><br>

								This scripture is the ultimate thinking small scripture.  Both of these commandments are so difficult to fulfill.  Are they visible when fulfilled or not fulfilled?  Absolutely.  There are people that you know that, because they do both these things, their life looks different than others.  However, often the start of these commandments begin in the quiet and unnoticed places of our lives. This is so tough for me, because I am a big picture person!  Details are not my strong suit.  I want my big picture vision to play out without having to do the work of the “little” details.  But details are what make things excellent and set a part.<br><br>

								What I am finding out is that the process of blessing those who curse me often starts with sitting on my couch, asking God how I should better treat people.  No one sees that process.  My couch assessing time won’t make me famous or a big deal in the eyes of anyone except God, who says to love him and love people.  The loving people part often requires a lot of begging God to help me.  What a beautiful circular process that God has created.  I can’t love people well on my own, so I go to God who loves me deeply, cultivate my relationship with him, then out of that I am able to love people better.  Then, because people won’t treat me well just because I treat them well, I once again go back to Jesus desperately in need of him to love well.<br><br>

								Relationships matter.  People matter.  While loving people probably won’t get you a book contract or the best job in the world, I believe it will change how you see the world which will in turn change you.  So let’s try thinking small and putting our phone away while we are checking out at the store.  Let’s think about how Jesus would respond to someone being mean.  Let’s sit with God who has all clarity, all knowledge, all love, and all wisdom. And let’s celebrate the little victories so that we become more aware of how much those little things actually matter most.

								Change Exposed...
							</span>
						</td>

						<td class='articleBlog'>
								Change is not a part of life.<br>
								It is life.<br>
								It isn’t avoidable.<br>
								It isn’t easy.<br>
								It is often forceful and unkind.<br>
								It exposes the rawness of our soul.<br>
								For better or for worse, change always comes.<br>
								It isn’t something I can run from, because when I can’t run any farther<br>
								Something has changed.<br><br>

								Hearts are broken. Souls are revived.<br>
								Babies are born. Funerals are survived.<br>
								Weddings are planned. Traffic is jammed.<br>
								And in it all the human experience is the same.<br><br>

								We are all fearful. We are all to blame.<br>
								We experience laughter and we endure pain.<br>
								We conquer mountains.<br>
								Then wonder how we’ll make it through the next day.<br><br>

								Life moves on. An easy statement to say,<br>
								But my feelings curse it on my worst day.<br>
								What if I’m stuck in a place that feels like forever?<br>
								What if the plan I had planned fades away?<br>
								Am I the only one that sits and cries alone?<br>
								<br>
								There’s nothing new under the sun.<br>
								Those before me have felt the sting of defeat.<br>
								They have felt love.<br>
								They have feared disease.<br>
								<br>
								How do I become so consumed?<br>
								With self-pity and feelings of impending doom?<br>
								I open my eyes to see everyone has a reason to bleed.<br>
								Maybe there is beauty in the idea that I’m not so unique.<br>
								<br>
								So when I am yelling at the sky<br>
								Because change has burned, hurt, and stung<br>
								May I cling tightly to the truth that in it all,<br>
								HE IS ENOUGH.

								To Those Who Helped Raise Me...
						</td>

						<td class='articleBlog'>
								For the past 20 years you have helped raise me.  You have walked through some of my darkest days with me.  You have lived your life as an example worthy of being followed.  You have helped shape me into the person that I am today and there is no way to properly say “Thank You“.  But I shall try anyways.  And if you are thinking that I’m not talking to you just know that I am.<br><br>

								As I begin a new adventure in the state of Colorado I have reflected on my life here in Missouri.  My parents left their home and their family to move to this place 20 years ago.  It was a new adventure full of apprehension, excitement, and sadness.  Thankfully, because of my mom’s big personality no one was a stranger for very long.  The community we established ourselves into became like our family.  You became our family.  Some of you taught me about Jesus every week in Sunday School, many of you spent hours laughing and telling stories with me.  You came over for holidays, watched my performances, picked me up from school, cared about what was going on in my life, and I watched you live your life full of God and integrity.  You’ve encouraged me.  You’ve believed in me.  You’ve equipped me.  You have trusted me with your kid’s hearts and allowed me to grow by investing in them.<br><br>

								When my world fell apart and my mom was gone you mourned with me.  You brought my family food, cleaned our house, asked how we were, cried with us, laughed with us, and sat in the ashes beside us.  You have been present in my life, through the good and through the incredibly painful, you have been with me.  You have embodied compassion, care, fun, and most importantly Jesus.<br><br>

								As I considered moving to a different place to do something that I love and feel called to I carefully weighed what it means to leave my home and my family.  It was an incredibly difficult decision and one I made with tears in my eyes.  Joel and I are leaving our families here and for us that is like 400 people.  But we know that God is in this process.  He has said no to a lot of things that we have pursued and this time He said yes.  So we are going.  With joy, excitement, and sadness we are going.<br><br>

								The other night, as I watched a kid play guitar and sing at Vintage Paris, I sat grateful because God doesn’t waste anything.  Joel gave this boy his first guitar lessons.  Joel was taught guitar from mom and became the musician he is because of so many of the people that we grew up playing music alongside.  We are seeing the dispersement of God’s grace and faithfulness throughout many different places.  We are seeing legacy already!  We are seeing Him move and we are moving.  It is so hard to leave home.  It is so hard to leave the people who have raised and cared for me for 20 years.  But I take what I have learned and I get to share it with other people in a different place.  I get to share YOU with other people.<br><br>

								My hope is that through this note you feel my gratitude because it is so huge.  My hope is that you also feel encouraged.  The life God has given you has impacted me and so many others.  I pray that you feel used by God and that you continue to invest in people the way you invested, encouraged, and believed in me.  I pray you begin to the see the ripple effect that has started because of you.  I hope in the times when you grow tired and weary that you remember that I am just one of the many people who has needed you, been influenced by you, and forever changed by you.  See you at Christmas, Family!
